# TODO -- A Case Study
 The intention of this project is to take a look at the full lifecycle of a modern day platform. It is a twist on a simple project intended to help solidify knowledge of a platform that implements a To-do list similar to that you would see on a kitchen fridge. I plan to implement the following over the next few weeks:
   
  - A microservice written in Scala that uses Twitters Finagle... A lightweight RPC written with high concurrency in mind.
  - A REST-ful Node based service that theoretically will be interchangable with the above
  - An Android Application that will implement the above services, but will be ignorant to the services implementation.
    
  I think this will be a great tool (once completed) for those who would love to see a basic implementation of how code gets from a server, to a mobile device, and back all in one place. I also intend to try out new architectures that will help me understand what the advantages and consequences are of something like that of Clean Architecture, or a Z-based architecture.
