# Android Data Layer
This is the data layer for the android application. It will host the logic for networking in our application. Please remember that we will NOT have our business logic (located in the android-domain module) dependent on our network. We should only communicate with Interactors, so our data layer is dependent on our domain layer.

This is a WIP.
